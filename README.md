# SASYABoutique

SASYA Boutique Management System is proposed for SASYA Boutique which is located in Masjid Tanah, Melaka. The purpose of this system is to implement the computerization of the products inventory and sales. The current system that is used by SASYA Boutique is quite tedious. Data stored on papers is subject to loss due to physical damage. Furthermore, a large number of ledger books has to be maintained for each transaction. Sometime manual calculation may be incorrect thus, leading to the incorrect information. Besides, generating the daily sales and monthly sales manually is a time consuming task as the user need to go through one by one sales. SASYA Boutique Management System will be a great of help in order to reduce the problems. The staff details, customer details, item details, purchase, billing, and report generation can be maintained through the system. The system will keep the record of required information and will perform the operations such as computing calculations by scanning the barcode of the items, automatic report generation, adding, deleting, updating, and searching. The methodology that has been use for the project is Agile Methodology. This project is developed by using Notepad++ as front end and SQL Server as back end. As for the scripting, Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP) language, JavaScript, and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) will be use.
